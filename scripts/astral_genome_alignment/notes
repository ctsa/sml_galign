simplist way to do it:
clustal aligned orthologs used as psi-blast input to search against pdbaa
  [ optional: one or two rounds of psi-blast search against the nr first? ]
take anything better than some low e-val with a gap cutoff
get burial dsspsa and dsspsecstruct linked to each aligned position

align to astral 95% id domain sequences
